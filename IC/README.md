The project was created to handle with a large number of train bookings. 
The main reason is business trips, one or two days, unfortunately, filling the same forms
repeatedly can make a person nervous. 

So I created a class, which eliminates this problem, from where and to where we travel, 
on which day and at what time, and the day and time of return. The rest of the conditions 
are assigned in the code: discounted student, direct connection, window seat, carriage 
without compartments. 

As part of the development of the idea, I am thinking of creating a GUI with the ability 
to manipulate the rest of the variables and search history.
